Description
======
The topics covered in this unit include diode rectifiers, three-phase diode rectifiers, thyristor controlled rectifiers, DC/DC converters, single-phase inverters, three-phase PWM inverters and magnetics. Students are able to acquire in-depth technical competence in (1) understanding the principles and characteristics of power electronics circuits and systems; (2) determination of suitable topologies and control mechanisms to satisfy power conversion requirements; and (3) predicting the capabilities and performance of standard power converters.

Outcomes
======
Students are able to (1) explain the principle of operation of diode and thyristor rectifiers, DC/DC converters, inverters and AC voltage controllers; (2) analyse and design diode and thyristor rectifiers, DC/DC converters, inverters, AC voltage controllers, inductors and isolation transformers; (3) demonstrate the ability to use datasheets of power electronics devices and related ICs for the design of power electronics circuits; (4) explain the characteristics of power electronics devices; (5) analyse and design adjustable speed DC and AC motor drives; (6) perform analysis and design of power electronics circuits using software packages, PSpice and PSIM; and (7) demonstrate professional engineering skills and abilities when working in teams.

Role
======
1. Lab demonstrator: setting and demonstrating the lab sessions.
2. Tutor: deliver the tutor and pratical sessions.
