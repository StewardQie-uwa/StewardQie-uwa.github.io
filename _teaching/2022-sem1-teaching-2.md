Description
======
This unit covers power network structures and steady-state model; power-flow analysis formulation; voltage and reactive-power control; short-circuit fault analysis; control in fault operating conditions; power systems protection; power and frequency control; and stability. The academic objective of the unit is for students to achieve a broad and in-depth education in the subject of power transmission and control.

Outcomes
======
Students are able to (1) demonstrate professional engineering skills and abilities when working in teams; (2) demonstrate the ability to model power systems components (transmission lines, transformers, generators and loads); (3) analyse the power flow of a simple interconnected power system with multiple sources and loads using Gauss-Siedal, Newton Raphson, and decoupled power flow methods; (4) analyse the impact of short-circuit faults on the power network and make design changes to the network to control the fault currents; (5) describe and analyse various protection schemes for power transmission and distribution systems; and (6) describe and analyse the techniques for control of voltage and frequency of interconnected power systems.

Role
======
1. Teaching assistant
