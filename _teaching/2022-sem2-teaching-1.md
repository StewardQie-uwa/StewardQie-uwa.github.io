Description
======
This unit provides students with topics including classical linear control theory and its applications and limitations. It focuses on linear control systems, the concept of stability, time domain and frequency domain analysis, compensation and synthesis of single variable systems. The unit also introduces students to common control hardware (sensors, actuators, their placement, controllers) and software (such as MATLAB and LabVIEW). The unit also contains laboratories and examples from the chemical process, electrical, mechanical and mechatronics industries. Process and instrumentation diagrams and sensors/actuators in control systems are also covered.

Outcomes
======

Students are able to (1) categorise classical control theory and its applications; (2) analyse linear control systems using classical control techniques; (3) design and test feedback control systems using classical control techniques; (4) justify solutions to control system problems; and (5) work effectively in a diverse team to achieve professional outcomes.
