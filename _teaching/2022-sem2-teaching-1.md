Description
======
This unit covers the theory of three-phase circuits, transformer models, DC and AC machines (synchronous and induction), equivalent circuits and performance relations (torque-speed relation, speed and voltage regulation, efficiency calculation).

Outcomes
======
Students are able to (1) demonstrate an ability to work effectively in laboratory teams; (2) analyse two basic principles (generation of EMF and torque) that govern electromagnetic energy conversion and differentiate between motor and generator operation; (3) analyse the performance (regulation, losses and efficiency) of DC machines, transformers, induction and synchronous machines based on the equivalent circuits; (4) explain the working principle of transformers and AC electrical machines by using phasor diagrams ; (5) analyse torque-speed characteristics to develop speed control techniques for DC and induction motors; (6) develop transmission line parameters and power system representation; and (7) demonstrate compliance with work, health and safety regulations, codes and standards when operating electrical machines.

Role
======
1. Lab demonstrator
2. Marking
